### Problem Statement

The 1st Line Financial Crime team, which is part of the Business Operations team, is
responsible for protecting Kroo and its customers from fraudulent activities. Youâ€™ve been
asked by your line manager to have a look and analyse a sample of mock customer data
and share your findings with the Heads of Fincrime and Compliance.

### Propose a model 
Propose a model for assessing customer risk level (High/Medium/Low)(assume fraud
confirmed means confirmed that the customers are bad actors). How did you get to
your conclusion? What other attributes would you suggest us could consider?

## Approach
1. Exploring and Cleaning Data
2. Applying PCA to reduce dimension
3. Clusturing data into 3 groups
4. Identifying type of cluster by exploring data
5. Creating ML model to classify customer
